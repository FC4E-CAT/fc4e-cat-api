# FAIRCORE4EOSC - CAT: Compliance Assessment Toolkit

The Compliance Assessment Toolkit will support the EOSC PID policy with services to encode, record, and query compliance with the policy. To do so, a wide range of compliance requirements ( TRUST, FAIR, PID Policy, Reproducibility, GDPR, Licences) will be evaluated as use cases for definition of a conceptual model. At the same time, vocabularies, concepts, and designs are intended to be re-usable for other compliance needs: TRUST, FAIR, POSI, CARE, Data Commons, etc. This will be followed by a supporting service specification (the framework), accompanied  by development and testing of operational services for PID Policy Compliance monitoring.

## FAIRCORE4EOSC - CAT: Compliance Assessment Toolkit - API

This is the repository of the CAT API that allows for the encoding, recording, and querying of compliance assessments. Operational examples will support EOSC PID Policy compliance, while FAIR and TRUST will be available as beta versions.

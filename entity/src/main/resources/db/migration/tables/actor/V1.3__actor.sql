These rules may include setting standards for lexical formats, algorithms and protocols to ensure global uniqueness, together with setting quality of service conditions to enforce compliance to the rules. PID Authorities may be organisations (e.g. DOI.org), which enforce control over a PID infrastructure.'),

PID Service Providers have responsibility for the provision, integrity, reliability and scalability of PID Services, in particular the issuing and resolution of PIDs, but also lookup and search services, and interoperability with a generic resolution system.'),

      ('PID Manager','PID Managers have responsibilities to maintain the integrity of the relationship between entities and their PIDs, in conformance to a PID Scheme defined by a PID Authority. A PID Manager will typically subscribe to PID services to offer functionality to PID Owners within the PID Managerâ€™s services.'),
      ('PID Owner','An actor (an organisation or individual) who has the authority to create a PID, assign PID to an entity, provide and maintain accurate Kernel Information for the PID. A new PID Owner must be identified and these responsibilities transferred, if the current PID Owner is no longer able to carry them out.'),
      ('End User','The end user of PID Services, for example researchers, or software, or services produced to support researchers.'),
      ('Compliance Monitoring','On completion, the work will support an additional role and associated component for the EOSC PID Policy, as follows: Compliance Monitoring (Role) - One or more organisations that provide services to monitor and/ or enforce compliance (with PID Policy), resulting in interoperable and aggregatable compliance metrics for the roles and components foreseen in the policy.');
